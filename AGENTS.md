# Repository standing rules

1. Work on a branch. Open a pull request for every change. Never push directly to main.
2. Tests must pass before a PR is opened. If the repo has no tests, add a smoke test for what you changed.
3. Never commit secrets, API keys or credentials. Never invent credentials, licences or metrics.
4. Keep the README honest: what works, what is live, and the live URL.
5. At the end of the day, create (if it does not exist) the issue "10-day agent program — daily log" and post your report as a comment, in this format:

   ## Day N — <repo>
   Did: <bullets, each with PR/commit link>
   Blocked on: <anything needing Amartya>
   Will do tomorrow: <bullets>
   Live status: <URL or "not live yet — blocked by …">

   Then stop. Do not start new work after the report.

## Day 1: triage only

Get oriented, get CI green, fix existing bugs, and set up reporting. No new features.
SwiftUI iOS code cannot be built in this Linux cloud environment. Focus on
correctness and logic, rely on macOS CI for build verification, and state what
could not be verified without Xcode.
